                           The manner in which we characterize and deal with the Psychological Contract, and how we comprehend and apply its supporting standards in our connections - inside and outside of work - basically characterizes our humankind.<br><br> 
                           Regard, sympathy, trust, compassion, decency, objectivity - characteristics like these portray the Psychological Contract, similarly as they describe an acculturated viewpoint to life overall.<br><br>The responsible individual has the vital position and ability for such extreme duty.<br><br>
                           Responsibility isn't reasonable or sensible where authority and ability are insufficient for the obligation concerned.<br><br>Responsibility is diverse to obligation. Responsibility isn't by and large assigned, while duty usually is.<br><br>Responsibility for the most part requires an individual to have obligation reaching out past the exhibition of an assignment or obligation, to having opportunity in deciding and possibly changing how the duty is worked out 
                           <br><br>The acknowledgment of moral duty is which isolates the grown-up from the kid. It's the incredible jump forward into development.<br><br> Obligation is the sign of the completely incorporated, completely working person.

                          <p>Solving the problem in the right possible way with the right gloves is the secret of creativity.<br><br><b>Creative Problem Solving (CPS):</b> is a deliberate process for solving problems or finding opportunities, used when you want to go beyond conventional thinking and arrive at creative (novel and useful) solutions.<br><br>(You can see an illustration of the model here.) 
                           When <b>facilitating CPS,</b> the most important word in the description above is "deliberate." Whenever CPS is used, someone is responsible for facilitating the process; that is, for making process-related decisions, for using the process correctly and effectively, and for assuring that the goal is reached - that a novel, useful, and implementable solution is found.<br><br>
                           First, let's consider problems and opportunities. CPS is a great choice if you want new thinking, new ideas, new solutions.<br>It's a great choice if you find you are stuck, if you can't solve a certain problem (or problems), even if - especially if - you're not sure what the problem is.<br>CPS is a great choice if you are missing opportunities, or if you want to take advantage of the opportunities before you. 
                           <br><br>Second, let's consider leadership. Creative thinking and innovative vision are core leadership competencies. CPS provides a structured way for leaders to harness creative thinking, to lead the way to breakthrough innovations, to envision desired future states, and to determine how to get there.

However they are not trained on managing the performance of their team members.<br><br>They are unable to use effective people skills to deal with work and performance related issues.<br>This project defines `Managing People’ as an ongoing communication process between the manager and the team member.  Both need to be clear about the role definition, performance parameters and priorities, success criteria, understanding barriers to performance and ‘raising the bar’.

                           Create a greater appreciation on your role as a leader in the existing environment and initiate activities in line with this role.<br><br>
